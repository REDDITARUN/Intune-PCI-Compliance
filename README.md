## Abstract
This project discusses the implementation of a comprehensive data loss prevention solution integrated with privileged identity management using Microsoft Intune. It outlines the steps taken to ensure PCI DSS compliance and highlights the significant benefits achieved, including reduced risk of data loss and enhanced protection against cyber threats.

## Why Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is Required
Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is crucial for organizations because it helps:
- Protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Secure sensitive information and critical systems.
- Ensure compliance with various security standards and regulations.
- Reduce the risk of internal threats by managing privileged access.

## Uses of PIM
PIM is used to:
- Control and monitor access to sensitive systems and data.
- Enforce least privilege access policies.
- Provide temporary elevated access when needed.
- Audit and report on privileged access activities.

## How Microsoft Intune Supports PIM
Microsoft Intune supports PIM through:
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Ensures that only authorized users can access privileged accounts.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Defines roles and permissions to manage who can access specific resources.
- **Password Management**: Enforces strong password policies and regular password changes.
- **Device Management**: Secures and manages devices accessing corporate resources.
- **Compliance Policies**: Ensures devices and applications meet security standards and compliance requirements.

## Additional Information
- For more details on the implementation process, security measures, and compliance steps, please refer to the comprehensive guide provided in this repository. The guide includes in-depth explanations, configurations, and best practices to ensure a robust and secure setup.
